* Notes about our Influxdb installations
We installed the 0.9.5 Influxdb version on our test server, but during backup restoring, we got the following error:\\
restoring from snapshot hangs forever on [metastore] 2017/07/16 10:47:13 temporary accept error: listener closing

We solved using the 0.9.6 version, that was not simple to be found and where the previous bug was solved:\\
- wget https://dl.influxdata.com/influxdb/releases/influxdb_0.9.6_amd64.deb
- sudo dpkg -i influxdb_0.9.6_amd64.deb
- sudo influxd restore -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf my_backup

As root we changed influxdb folder permissions:\\
- cd /var/lib/influxdb
- chown -R influxdb:influxdb *

And we started the influxdb service:\\
- service influxdb start

We were not able to import the db snapshot in the 1.2 Influxdb version, because first it needs to be imported in the 0.10 version, exported again in another format and finally imported in the 1.2 version. These steps can be found here: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.2/administration/upgrading/#upgrade-from-0-10-or-0-11-to-1-2 where a note says:"0.10 users will need to convert any remaining b1 and bz1 shards to TSM format before following the instructions below. InfluxDB 1.2 cannot read non-TSM shards." and tsm1 storage engine was introduced only starting from the 0.10 version (as reported here https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.10/administration/upgrading/#convert-b1-and-bz1-shards-to-tsm1).
* Import issues
** Influx is not able to start due to lacking of Raft consistency
   /Report of the issues encountered on 20170829 including all step followed./

   1) After importing the database or not all data in the database is available. E.g.: missing =MEASUREMENTS=.
   2) In the Influxd log at =/var/log/influxdb/influxd.log/= there are traces reporting =Connection refused= errors on the IP address of the server where the backup has been created. Of course this IP is not available on the target server, where the backup has just been restored.
   3) Import the backup setting specific =metadir= folder:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      influxd restore -config=/etc/influxdb/influxdb.confe -metadir=/var/lib/influxdb/meta/ /media/InfluxDB-0.9-volume/influxdb_0.9_backup.tar
      #+END_SRC
      The flag =-metadir= did not work with errors like:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      restore: flag provided but not defined: -metadir
      #+END_EXAMPLE
   4) Create new interface with using the source server IP
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.122.13 up
      #+END_SRC
      This solution did not work (initially), since after an Influx restart the DB was not present
   5) Re-import and use original =meta= folder
      1) Cleared all form =/var/lib/influxdb= and restarted Influx
      2) Copy original =meta= folder containing =raft.db=  file with correct IP
      3) Re-imported dump
      4) Before start Influx backup =meta= folder into =meta.restored= folder
      5) Copied the original =meta= folder in /var/lib/influxdb=
      6) Started the service

      This step did not work, rollback done and Influx restarted.
   6) Test again after few hours (~15) Influx runs and database is available with all data. In Influx log file and in =/var/lib/influxdb/meta/raft.db= the source server IP is reported. Probably step 4) is the one that solved the main problem.

** Influx log report errors about inconsistency between localhost and 192.168.122.13
   /Report of the issues encountered on 20170915/

   *Issue:*
   - In logs we have:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     "ERR: read response size: read tcp 127.0.0.1:8088: connection reset by peer"
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - File =/var/lib/influxdb/meta/peers.json= contains two IPs:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ["localhost:8088","192.168.122.13:8088"]
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   *Solution:*
   - Stop the server
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     service influxdb stop
     #+END_SRC

   - It is mandatory to configure the correct IP in the =[meta]= section in =influxdb.conf= as follow:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     [meta]
     dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"
     hostname = "192.168.122.13"
     bind-address = "192.168.122.13:8088"
     retention-autocreate = true
     election-timeout = "1s"
     heartbeat-timeout = "1s"
     leader-lease-timeout = "500ms"
     commit-timeout = "50ms"
     cluster-tracing = false
     #+END_EXAMPLE

   - Delete the peers.json file
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     rm /var/lib/influxdb/meta/peers.json
     #+END_SRC

   - Start the server
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     service influxdb start
     #+END_SRC
